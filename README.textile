h1. Rubber Band JNI - Controlling Real-Time Audio Time-Stretching from Java

This repository contains an example of real-time pitch-shifting and audio time-stretching in Java. It uses two components. The first component is "a high quality software C++ library for audio time-stretching and pitch-shifting C++ called Rubber Band":http://breakfastquay.com/rubberband/. The second component is a Java audio library called "TarsosDSP":https://github.com/JorenSix/TarsosDSP. To bridge the gap between the two JNI(Java Native Interface) is used. Rubber Band provides a JNI interface and starting from the currently unreleased version 1.8.2, makefiles are provided that make compiling and subsequently using the JNI version of Rubber Band relatively straightforward.

h2. Installation

To get the example working several elements need to be in place. 1) To compile Rubber Band a C++ tool-chain needs to be available on your system. This includes a compiler and related tools like @make@. 2) The dependencies for Rubber Band should be installed, otherwise compilation is impossible. 3) A JDK should be installed to compile java files and to provide the JNI header files. Here we assume that a JDK and C++ tool-chain is already available. The rest is explained for Debian 8.1 but should be transferable to any Unix like system.

To install the dependencies on Debian, install following packages:

@sudo apt-get install vamp-plugin-sdk libsndfile1-dev libfftw3-dev libvamp-sdk2 libvamp-hostsdk3 libsamplerate0-dev@

Once the dependencies are installed correctly the following should work:

<pre>
<code>
# Download and unzip and the latest source code
wget https://bitbucket.org/breakfastquay/rubberband/get/46805fcedf7e.zip
unzip 46805fcedf7e.zip 
# Change the working directory
cd breakfastquay-rubberband-46805fcedf7e
# If the dependencies are installed correctly the following will work
./configure
# Compile the source code
make
# Create the JNI library, set JAVA_HOME to your JDK directory
make jni JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64/
# Copy the newly created JAR-file and native library to the lib directory
cp lib/rubberband.jar ../lib/
cp lib/librubberband-jni.so ../lib/
# change the working directory
cd ../build
# Build the RubberBandJNI jar file with Apache Ant
ant
cd ..
</code>
</pre>

If everything went well there are a few new files on your system. @lib/rubberband.jar@ contains the Java part of the JNI-bridge. @lib/librubberband-jni.so@ contains Rubber Band C++ JNI bridge compiled for your system. @build/RubberBandJNI.jar@ contains the example application of this repository. If those files are created correctly, you are ready to run RubberBandJNI. The application needs to be started with a correct @java.library.path@:

@java -Djava.library.path=lib/ -jar build/RubberBandJNI.jar@

Watch out: the order of the options does matter: the @-D@ option should appear before @-jar@. Finally, to clean up remove the previously downloaded source code.
